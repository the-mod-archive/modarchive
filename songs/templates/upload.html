<p>
    Uploading is simple enough, just browse and select the module from your hard disk. Alternatively, multiple files in a zipped archive is also supported. You can also upload individually zipped modules one at a time.
</p>

<p>
There is a maximum file size limit on uploads, so please ensure that your file is no larger than 15mb for a single module (standalone-upload) or 25mb for a multi-upload ZIP file. Are you really sure you want to upload a 15MB module file? Unless it is an EXCEEDINGLY GOOD track, large modules that are larger than an MP3 render of the same length will probably not be considered for archiving.
