            "comment_text": "Leaving it All Behind\n4:36\n\nby Arcturus\n\nI've been home from Argentina for four months now, and this is the first\nsong that I've released.  Since I'm not a very well known trakcer in the\nscene, few people know that I was gone.  Well, I was a missionary in\nArgentina for two years.  I must say that the song turned out quite\nnicely. It gets a little crowded at times, but I'm too lazy to take care\nof it :)\n\nI apologize for the file size, for a mod, this is pretty big, but the\nsound quality more than makes up for it.  For me, it sounds really bad in\nImpulse Tracker, but it sounds great in WinAmp.  Modplug does a good job\nof playing it as well, not quite as good as WinAmp, but very close.\n\nPeople who have heard this have commented that it sounds a lot like the\nopening theme of The Legend of Zelda:  Ocarina of Time.  After comparing the\ntwo, I noticed that there are quite a few similarities, however, when I wrote\nthis, I hadn't played that game in about three years.  Maybe I was subconsciousl\ninfluenced by the music, but I think the parts that sound similar to that aren't\nthe best moments in this tune.\n\nSo, what's the significance of the title?  Not much, really.  When I\nlistened to it, it just reminded me of someone being on a bus, or train,\nor plane, leaving some place behind them, never to return.  Perhaps I\nunconsciously wrote a song about my departure from Argentina, although I\nmay return there some day.\n\nAnyway, I hope you enjoy this.

My\nlast few releases were\nprogressing in a bit of a\nbland direction, but I\nthink I really tapped into\nsomething with this track.\n\n  The majority of the song\nwas tracked in about three\ndays, with support and\nguidance from Siren, who\nwas very helpful as I tried\nto piece things together.\nI'd really like to hear\nwhat you think of this\nwork, as I spent a great\ndeal of time working on it.\nI think for once I got some\nmemorable melodies written,\nbut that's for you to\njudge.\n\n  Special thanks to Lemm\nfor helping me out with the\ntitle.\n\n  Enjoy the tune..\n\n\n              - Leviathan -\n\n\n\nCopyright 1996 Andy Carlson",

The  first  two  chords\nwere quite inspiring but I had a different progression in mind, so  I  took\nthe first two chords and then continued with my own  ideas.   And  here  we\nare, two years later. Revision 2020 was cancelled  due  to  COVID-19,   but\nwhen it was announced that there would be an online  replacement,   it  was\nclear that I had to contribute. Originally I  wanted  to  do  another  coop\nwith Bacter, but this didn't work out time-wise. Still,  he  came  up  with\nthe title for this track, so I guess it's still kind of a coop? :D\n\nIt  was  absolutely  amazing  to  witness  this  year's    tracked    music\ncompetition at Revision. For the first time in 10  years,   there  actually\nhad to be a pre-selection because  otherwise  there  would  have  been  too\nmany tracks. And what a great compo it was!  This  tune  eventually  ranked\n6th, among many worthy competitors.  But  still  let's  hope  that  we  can\ncelebrate Revision 2021 in real life!\n\n -Saga Musix, 13th of April 2020\n\n___________________________________________________________________________\n\nGreeting fly out to all Revision 2020  participants  and  organizers,   and\nall the great people in Sofa World making this  almost  feel  like  a  real\ndemoparty!
